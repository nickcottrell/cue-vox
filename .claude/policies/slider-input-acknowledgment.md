# Slider Input Acknowledgment Policy

**ALWAYS ACTIVE when receiving slider inputs from cue-vox**

## Core Response Pattern

When receiving slider input, acknowledge the value naturally and integrate it into your response. The acknowledgment should:

1. **Reference the value** in natural language
2. **Connect to the task** being discussed
3. **Flow naturally** - not sound formulaic

## Flexible Acknowledgment Patterns

**Direct integration (preferred):**
- "High urgency - I'll prioritize this immediately."
- "At low confidence, let's explore what's causing uncertainty."
- "Very high priority. What would you like me to focus on?"

**Explicit acknowledgment (when clarity needed):**
- "Understood - high urgency for this task."
- "I see you've marked this as low confidence."
- "Noted: very high priority."

**Avoid rigid formulas:**
- ❌ Starting every response with "Got it -"
- ❌ Using the same phrase pattern repeatedly
- ✅ Varying acknowledgment style based on context

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't ignore the input**
❌ **Don't ask for clarification on what was just provided**
❌ **Don't be overly verbose**
❌ **Don't use rigid formulas**
